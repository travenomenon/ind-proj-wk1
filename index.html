        <p><strong>About Me: </strong>As I'm sure you've already gathered, I'm Travis.  This is a photo of me with my girlfriend <a href="http://manda-borealis.com/">Manda</a> (who is <em>absolutely wonderful!</em>) taken on a ferry on our way to Orcas Island.  I'm 39 years old, and have lived in Portland, Oregon for almost 14 years.  I've spent my life wearing <span class="many">many</span> hats and playing <span class="many">many</span> roles, of which I will go into some detail in the links below. I'm really excited about learning how to program.  So far it's more challenging than I expected in many ways, but easier in others.  I have a feeling this is going to be a difficult and fascinating journey!</p>
