# Epicodus Independent Project Week 1.

 This project is a chance to self-evaluate the concepts and techniques I have learned over the course of this first week at Epicodus by building a personal portfolio webpage.  Concepts to be put into practice include basic HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP, cascading, and GIT, among others.

## Getting Started

1. Open Terminal
2. Clone the repository using "git clone https://github.com/travenomenon/ind-proj-wk1.git"
3. Browse and inspect contents

### Prerequisites

You will need to be able to access the terminal and have a text editor installed to make any changes.

```
Examples:
terminal - Git Bash (Windows)
text editor - Atom
```
