              <br>
              <p>My education (beyond high-school and a very short college career) has thus far been self-motivated and derived from networking, online resources, word-of-mouth and personal, hands-on experience. When I've needed to learn something, I've found a way to find and apply the information if possible. In the instances that I found myself floundering, I've reached out in every direction available. The perfect example of this being that I'm now here at Epicodus, learning code!</p>

              <h2 class="panel-title">Why I want To Learn To Code</h2>
              <br>
              <p>My choice to begin learning to code is rooted in several places.  First is the desire to take on a new challenge, and to expand my overall ability as a person by learning a new language. Of course, the potential financial gains and security are also quite motivating! On that note, the ability to be able to work remotely is probably the most appealing aspect, as I am a person that  <em>needs</em> to travel, frequently, and being able to fund my further adventures from any place that has a WiFi connection is the best way to make that happen.</p>
